## About Dataset (From Kaggle)

Masks play a crucial role in protecting the health of individuals against respiratory diseases, as is one of the few precautions available for COVID-19 in the absence of immunization. With this dataset, it is possible to create a model to detect people wearing masks, not wearing them, or wearing masks improperly.

This dataset contains `853` images belonging to the `3` classes, as well as their bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format.

The classes are:

* With mask;
* Without mask;
* Mask worn incorrectly.
